## :microscope: About the game

:clipboard: PROJECT-Solo is my first game using the PyGame lib. I developed this during my first semester of Computer Science, that's why it's so simple and basic. But let's talk about the game itself. It is a simple reimagination of the scene from Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back in which Han Solo and a few other characters must escape Hoth, avoiding the Imperial Blockade. 

:mag_right: All right. But how does it work? Simple: blaster shots will come at your direction, from the right corner of the screen towards the left one. You control the Millenium Falcon (Han's ship) using the keyboard arrows. You can move up, down, left, right and diagonals. The goal is to dodge 35 blaster shots, so that Han can escape. Each time you dodge a blast, the speed and damage they cause increase. Oh, and the ship has a shield, which drops as you get hit. It is still possible to survive and win with 0 shield energy, but failing to dodge another shot obviously results in defeat.

## :computer: How to play

<p>First, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed.</p>
<p>If you'd like to mess around with the code, feel free to do so.</p>
<p>You will need [Python3](https://www.python.org/) and [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) though.</p>
<p>I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as your code editor.</p>

#### :video_game: Rodando a aplicação

```bash

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/guicttram/PROJECT-Solo.git

```

That's pretty much it. The "game" folder contains the final build, with an executable. Just click and play. However, the .py files and necessary assets are also in the package, so feel free to edit the code, assets, execute through a code editor or even modify stuff and build your own game from it!
