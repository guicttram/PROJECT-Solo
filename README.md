## :microscope: About the game

:clipboard: PROJECT-Solo is my first game using the PyGame lib. I developed this during my first semester of Computer Science, that's why it's so simple and basic. But let's talk about the game itself. It is a simple reimagination of the scene from Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back in which Han Solo and a few other characters must escape Hoth, avoiding the Imperial Blockade. 

:mag_right: All right. But how does it work? Simple: blaster shots will come at your direction, from the right corner of the screen towards the left one. You control the Millenium Falcon (Han's ship) using the keyboard arrows. You can move up, down, left, right and diagonals. The goal is to dodge 35 blaster shots, so that Han can escape. Each time you dodge a blast, the speed and damage they cause increase. Oh, and the ship has a shield, which drops as you get hit. It is still possible to survive and win with 0 shield energy, but failing to dodge another shot obviously results in defeat.

## :computer: How to play

So, you should probably have Git installed. 
[Git](https://git-scm.com).
If you'd like to mess around with the code, feel free to do so. I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

#### :video_game: Rodando a aplicação

If you want to go straight to the point and just play the game:

```bash

# Clone esse repositório
$ git clone https://github.com/guicttram/proffy

# Acesse a pasta do projeto no seu VSCode
$ cd proffy

# Instale as dependências
$ npm install

# Execute a aplicação
$ npm start

# O servidor também iniciará na porta:5500 - acesse http://localhost:5500
```
